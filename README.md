# PaperQR 🧬 👩‍🔬 📡

For the nerds like myself who love reading scientific papers from hard copies, but recognize the advantage of digital reading when searching or sharing. This project tries to bring the best of both worlds. Automatically parsing the URL and adding a QR to the upper-left corner of the pdf before printing allows access to the file on your phone as a pdf.

Any science undergrad, graduate or PhD student will have dealt with reading multiple papers about a niche topic in a very short time, begging often the question “_where_ have I read about this?” Having access to the pdfs could simplify the process greatly.

Luckily, most modern papers you'll ever need—from arxiv.org/inspire.net—already contain a link to the corresponding downloading website. PaperQR knows how to automatically extract it, create a QR to the URL and access it from your phone.
